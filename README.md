Induction Task: This is a fun and interactive Anime Recommendation System that helps you find similar anime based on an image. Just upload a picture of an anime, and the app will suggest the top 5 most similar anime using advanced image recognition.

If you ever watched an anime and you want to watch another anime with that kinda scenesâ€”this app is for you!

The app uses a deep learning model (ResNet50), which is a powerful image recognition tool. It first analyzes the features of your uploaded anime image. Then, it compares those features with a collection of anime images stored in a database. The app finds the most visually similar anime and recommends them to you.
